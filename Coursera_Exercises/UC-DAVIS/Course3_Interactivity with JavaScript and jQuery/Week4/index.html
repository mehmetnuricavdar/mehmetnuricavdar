    <h1>Game of Pig</h1>
    <p>
      There are two players. The player whose turn it is rolls the dice. The
      total of the roll is added to the current player's score, unless either
      die comes up as a "one". If this happens, this player's turn is over, and
      it is the other player’s turn. After each roll, the current player can
      either roll again, (assuming a "one" was not rolled) or if the current
      player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player.
      The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and if you roll two "ones" (snake eyes), your current score gets
      zeroed out. So don’t do that.
